//Single Field Comparison: Use Comparable when thereâ€™s a single field (like roll number, name, or date) that naturally determines the order of objects.
//Multi-Field Comparison: Implement logic within compareTo to compare multiple fields when necessary (like salary and name).
//Consistent Sorting: Ideal when the class has a natural, consistent ordering that is used across different parts of your codebase.
